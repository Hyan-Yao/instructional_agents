\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Case Studies in Finance - Closing Thought}
    \begin{block}{Final Thought}
        As we explore the ethical considerations in the next slide, keep in mind how AI's capabilities must be balanced with responsibility and accountability in financial practices.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        As we integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sectors like healthcare and finance, 
        it is crucial to consider the ethical implications. AI technologies can offer substantial benefits, 
        but they also present significant challenges related to bias, privacy, and accountability.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Bias in AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Bias in AI occurs when algorithms produce systematic and unfair 
        discrimination against certain individuals or groups, often due to flawed data.
        
        \item \textbf{Example}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In healthcare, if an AI model is trained primarily on data from one demographic group 
            (e.g., Caucasian males), it may fail to provide accurate diagnoses for females or other 
            ethnic groups, leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Strive for diverse and representative datasets to minimize bias.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Privacy and Accountability}
    \begin{block}{Privacy Concerns}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Privacy relates to how personal data is collected, stored, and used 
            by AI systems. In sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance, unauthorized access 
            or misuse of information can have severe consequences.
            
            \item \textbf{Example}: The use of AI in analyzing patient records can potentially expose 
            sensitive medical information. If a health app shares data with third parties without patient 
            consent, it violates privacy rights.
            
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Establish robust data protection measures and obtain informed 
            consent from individuals whose data are being used.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Accountability and Transparency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Accountability refers to who is responsible when AI systems make 
            mistakes or cause harm. Transparency involves understanding how AI models reach their 
            conclusions (often referred to as "black box" issues).
            
            \item \textbf{Example}: If an AI algorithm used in finance incorrectly assesses credit risk, 
            leading to the denial of loans, it is crucial to identify who is accountable—whether the 
            developers, the institution, or the AI itself.
            
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Develop clear guidelines for accountability, and advocate for AI 
            model interpretability to ensure ethical use.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Summary Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bias}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Understand bias and edit datasets for fairness.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Privacy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement strong data privacy practices.
