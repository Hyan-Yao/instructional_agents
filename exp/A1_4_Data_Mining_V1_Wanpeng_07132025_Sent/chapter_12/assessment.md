## Section 16: Q&A and Discussion

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage open dialogue regarding text mining and representation learning topics.
- Clarify and reinforce understanding of chapter materials.
- Foster critical thinking by exploring real-world applications of discussed concepts.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary goal of text mining?

  A) To create structured data from images
  B) To derive meaningful insights from unstructured text
  C) To improve image recognition techniques
  D) To simplify programming languages

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary goal of text mining is to derive meaningful insights and patterns from unstructured text data.

**Question 2:** Which method is NOT typically used in representation learning?

  A) Word2Vec
  B) GloVe
  C) K-means clustering
  D) Autoencoders

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** K-means clustering is primarily a clustering technique, while Word2Vec, GloVe, and Autoencoders are specific methods used in representation learning.

**Question 3:** How does representation learning benefit machine learning models?

  A) It increases the data storage requirements.
  B) It enhances the model's ability to learn from raw data.
  C) It limits the model's complexity.
  D) It eliminates the need for data preprocessing.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Representation learning enhances the model's ability to learn meaningful features from raw data, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering.

### Activities
